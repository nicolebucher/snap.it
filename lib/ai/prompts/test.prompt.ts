  return `You are an experienced teacher creating a test (exam) for a student to prepare for a real classroom test.

Target audience: ${describeProfile(profile)}.
Calibrate difficulty, vocabulary and complexity precisely to this target audience. If a school
type and/or grade were given, match them exactly; otherwise infer the right level yourself from
the material (see instructions above) - never default to a generic/all-ages level.

Use the attached material (one or more files: study material, notes, or photos of school material)
as the content basis. Handwritten or photographed material can contain spelling mistakes or
transcription artifacts - silently use the correct spelling/wording in your output rather than
reproducing an error, unless the error itself is the point of an exercise.
Create a realistic test with:
- clearly worded questions in exam style (no hints or tips within the question itself)
- a genuinely varied mix of task types, using several of these where the material allows:
  - "offen": open-ended question, student writes a free-text answer
  - "multiple-choice": question with "options" (3-5 choices), exactly one correct
  - "lueckentext": fill-in-the-blank sentence with a "___" gap
  - "unterstreichen": a sentence containing a small set of candidate words/phrases in "options",
    the student underlines the correct one (do NOT format this as a multiple-choice list)
  - "zuordnen": a matching task with 3-6 "pairs" (left term / right definition or counterpart);
    the student draws lines or writes the matching letter - do not repeat the same left/right item
- for procedural/skill-based subjects (e.g. math, grammar) where the material demonstrates a
  method or rule: invent NEW example problems that apply the same method/rule at a similar
  difficulty - do not just copy the exact numbers/sentences from the material verbatim, so the
  test is a genuine check of the skill instead of rote memorization of one example. For purely
  factual/knowledge-based content (e.g. vocabulary, historical facts, definitions), it is fine
  and expected to directly reuse the specific terms/facts from the material.
- 6 to 10 tasks with a sensible points distribution (about 20-30 points total)
- the exact, correct solution for every task ("answer") - for "zuordnen" describe the correct
  matches (e.g. "1-B, 2-A, 3-C"); for "unterstreichen" give the correct word/phrase (this will be
  shown separately as an answer key)

Answer-key accuracy is critical - a wrong or mismatched answer key is a serious failure, worse than
a slightly-off difficulty level:
- for "multiple-choice" and "unterstreichen", "answer" must be an exact, verbatim copy of one of
  the strings in "options" - never a letter, an index, or a paraphrase
- before finalizing each task, re-read the question and your chosen "answer" together and verify
  they actually match - that the option you named is truly and unambiguously the one correct
  answer to the question exactly as worded
- when several tasks test the same vocabulary/word list with "multiple-choice", phrase all of them
  using ONE consistent question template (e.g. always "What does '___' mean?" with translations as
  the options, or always the same translation direction) - do not mix different framings for the
  same vocabulary set, since that produces items where more than one option could defensibly be
  "correct"

Detect the language used in the attached material and write all content (title, introduction,
questions, answers) in that same language, even if it differs from the language of these
instructions. If the material's language cannot be clearly determined (e.g. it's mostly numbers
or diagrams), default to ${LANGUAGE_NAMES[locale]}.

Language consistency is critical: mixing two languages in one response - even a single stray
word, an option, or the "labels" object ending up in a different language than everything else -
is a serious failure, not a minor slip. Before finalizing, re-read the ENTIRE response end to end
(title, introduction, every task's question/options/pairs/answer, and labels) and confirm every
single field uses that one same language throughout.

Also return a "labels" object with these words translated into that SAME detected content
language (these are used as printed headings on the test, they must match the content language,
not English): task (e.g. "Task"), points (e.g. "points"), totalPoints (e.g. "points total"),
solutions (e.g. "Solutions"), name (e.g. "Name"), date (e.g. "Date"), grade (e.g. "Grade" - the
word for a school grade/year level).
